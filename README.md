# Sprint1_T8_Lambdas

Level 1

All exercises must use the Java 8+ Java Lambdas and Streams API.

- Exercise 1

Given a list of Strings, write a method that returns a list of all strings that contain the letter 'o'. Print the result.

- Exercise 2

You have to do the same as in the previous point, but now, the method must return a list with the Strings that, in addition to containing the letter 'o', also have more than 5 letters. Print the result.

- Exercise 3

Create a list with the names of the months of the year. Print all elements of the list with a lambda.

- Exercise 4

Make the same impression as the previous point, but through method reference.

- Exercise 5

Create a Functional Interface with a method called getPiValue() that must return a double. From the main() of the main class, instantiate the interface and assign it the value 3.1415. Call the getPiValue() method and print the result.

- Exercise 6

Create a list with numbers and text strings and sort the list with the strings from shortest to longest.

- Exercise 7

Using the list from the previous exercise, now order it in reverse, from longest chain to shortest.

- Exercise 8

Create a Functional Interface that contains a method called reverse(). This method must receive and must return a String. In the main() of the main class, it injects into the interface created using a lambda, the body of the method, so that it returns the same string that it receives as a parameter but in reverse. It invokes the interface instance by passing it a string and checks if the result is correct.
